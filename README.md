# menu-api-project

This is a personal project that I am using to test myself on the skills I have learned.
The page has been built in React and styled with Sass.

I have tried to make a dynamic ecommerce page where customers would be able to order from the menu of a restaurant. The data is self written but I have tried to treat it in the same way as an API would be.

This is still a work in progress.
